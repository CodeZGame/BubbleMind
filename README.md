PROJECT INFOS


This project is under developement since december 2012. This project is an {EPITECH.} project (EPITECH is a french IT school).
There are actually three developpers working on this project : SALIDO Maxime [chief]; FRANCOUAL Benjamin; ANDRAL Laurent; All three are student at Epitech.

This project is part of the cursus and will be completed (in a way or another) for april 2013.
All sources, docs and everything else is free to use for anybody.

The objective of BubbleMind is to reproduce the tool Trendalyzer (initially developed by Hans Rosling's Gapminder Foundation) and acquired in March 2007 by Google Inc..
(http://gapminder.org/world)
At the present time, Trendalyzer is only developed in Flash, and can only be used to display information contained in Gapminder's Database.
What we want, is to develop an application in Javascript and using the lib Processing for the drawing, that reproduce this tool but that can be used to display any statistics listed in an CSV or ODF file.
More file format support may be added in a future version, or by the community (see docs/FormatFiles.txt for more infos).

==========
HOW TO USE


In order to use BubbleMind, you must have your file(s) formatted as required (see docs/FormatFiles.txt)
When your file are greatly formatted, it must be on your server. Then, you just have to go on the webpage (that integrate the application) and it's done !
Enjoy your nice data presentation !

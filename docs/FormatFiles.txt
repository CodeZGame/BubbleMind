ADD AN EXTRA FILE FORMAT SUPPORT (need to be done again)

If you want to add an extra file format support for BubbleMind, that's simple.
Your file must extend ALoaderFile class, and then add every single data to manager (DataEntryManager).
In order to do that you must call the method AddInfoToDataEntry of the manager.
You can also take a look at the UML (parsing.moo) or directly look into the source file.

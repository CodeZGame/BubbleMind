This file indicates how to greatly format your file in order to use the application correctly and
how to add an extra support for specific file format.

FILE FORMAT

CSV File:
	- A column must contain the name of the "entity"

	- A second column must contain the year

	- The first line must contains all the names of the column

	- Each lines must be formated as the first line with no value in a column if necessary

	(see example file: "csvExemple.csv")


ODF File:
	- //TODO

	(see example file: "odfExample.odf")


ADD AN EXTRA FILE FORMAT SUPPORT (need to be done again)

If you want to add an extra file format support for BubbleMind, that's simple.
Your file must extend ALoaderFile class, and then add every single data to manager (DataEntryManager).
In order to do that you must call the method AddInfoToDataEntry of the manager.
You can also take a look at the UML (parsing.moo) or directly look into the source file.
